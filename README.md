## Summary
Overall we see that Bobby will need to fill 72458 positions, and the two positions that will need to be filled the most will be Senior Engineer with 25916 people retiring and Senior Staff with 24926 retiring.

The mentorship program only has 1549 people that are eligible for the program thus Pewlett Hackard will have enough people to mentor the next generation of employees.
